* I was struggling with pulling updated information from GitHub back to my local computer. I was also struggling with when to create new branches in git, and what were appropriate times to commit.
* I think these concepts were clarified, in particular pulling from GitHub. Frank and I discussed the function of git fetch and git merge for a while until we figured out exactly what those commands did.
* We asked each other about certain commands that we were unsure about, and we asked Daniel what he considered an adequate commit message.
* I think that merging and working with branches can get a little confusing. The most difficulty I've had is trying to pull updated information from GitHub, but practicing has helped me figure it out.
* I enjoyed my first GPS pairing experience. I did feel a little flustered at first, which I made known to both our guide and my pair, because I was the driver and I was getting a little mixed up, and I was worried about what the guide would be thinking. However, once I calmed down, working with Frank was great because he was good at keeping me at a slower pace, and checked in consistently to make sure we were on the same page. I didn't notice Daniel too much, but he was a great resource to have when we got stuck. However, I liked how he stayed quiet even when we were having an issue, allowing us ample time to figure it out and resolve it ourselves without him just telling us what to do.
